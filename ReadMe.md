# ACS5413 Course Project - Dewayne Hafenstein

## University of Oklahoma - Gallogy School of Engineering 

This project represents a relatively comprehensive personal medical information management 
application that would allow a user to record medical related information.  This information 
would include:
- their insurance provider(s), 
- prescriptions and their dosage, 
- medical providers, 
- hospitals, 
- pharmacies, 
- their personal medical history (such as illnesses, surgeries, and other diagnosis), 
- alergies and the severity of them as well as mitigation, 
- and general contacts for medical personnel to reach people in the case of an emergency. 

The application provides map displays for doctors and hospitals to allow the user to 
navigate to these facilities easier.  Also, the prescriptions allows the user to take 
a picture of the medication for future reference and to help medical professionals 
identify the medication. 

The application also includes local notifications when it is time to take certain 
prescriptions as a reminder to the user.
